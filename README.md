# Eimeria_sample_inventory
An inventory of samples for Eimeria projects at the Heitlinger group


The current freezer inventory is number coded in /Eimeria_sample_inventory/Freezers_inventory_022020.csv
Coordinates of 3 numbers (x.x.x) representing 1) freezer, 2) tower within that freezer and 3) a row within that tower.
Tower order is from left to right in a freezer. Therefore when counting a row, skip to beginning of next row at the end,
continuing the numeric count. A "Z" pattern if you will.
This should later extend to room 108 residing -20 freezers.

1 = Blue -80, 
2 = White -80

example: 1.6.8 = Blue -80 freezer, 6th tower, 8th row
